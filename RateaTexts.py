ListTextUserGuide["stashBasics"] = Text('''
Adding Teas
To add a new tea to your stash, go to the "Tea Stash" window and click the "Add Tea" button.
You can also click "Duplicate Tea" to create a copy of the last tea in your stash. (Usually your last tea added)
Null/Invalid values are red.
                                      
Editing Teas
To edit a tea, select it from the list and click the "Edit Tea" button.
                                        
Adjusting Teas:
The standard adjustment assumes that you drank the tea but didn't record it.
The "Gift" adjustment assumes that you gave the tea away, so it will remove the tea from your stash but won't count it as drunk.
The "Sale" adjustment assumes that you sold the tea, so it will remove the tea from your stash and count the cost as negative, seperately from the tea.
If you mark the tea as "Finished" the remaining is counted as "Standard" aka drunk.
You can move a tea around by index. If you want to move a tea to ID=10, it will place it after the old ID=10 and renumber it as the new ID=10
                                        
Adding Reviews
To add a new review, first add a tea to your stash.
Then go to the "Tea Reviews" window and click the "Add Review" button.

ListTextUserGuide["stashFunctions"] = Text('''
Free Tea and Samples
Add a tea but keep the price at 0 or 0.1 to indicate that it is a free tea or sample.

Grouping Teas
You can group teas purchased together by adding it to the notes and duplicating it to each tea.
This will allow you to see the group of teas together in the "Tea Stash" window.
                                      
Logging a Trade
You should log a trade by logging a sale at fair market value, and then logging a purchase at the same value.
This will allow you to keep track of the trade and the value of the tea.
                                      
Filtering your teas
You can filter your teas by name with the search bar at the top of the "Tea Stash" window.
You can sort your teas by clicking the column headers in the "Tea Stash" window.
Columns can be reordered, hidden, and resized by right clicking the column header.

Tools for reviewing
You can use the "Timer" tool to time your tea sessions.
You can also use the "Notes" tool to write down your thoughts and observations about the tea.
Notes can be copy-pasted into the review for a easy way to keep track of your thoughts.

Cannonical rating system for RaTea
I made the program so I call the shots. I use this system.
The system is a 5 point float system where 5 cooresponds to S+, 4.5 to S, 4.25 to S-, 4 to A+, etc.
The grade of the tea determines the letter grade, while supporting details like value determine the decimal.
I personally grade the tea based on the Letter than add the + or - based on value.

Adding or Editing Categories
To add or edit categories, go to the "Categories" window. Be careful when adding or removing categories, as this can affect your existing teas and reviews.
This may delete data, so be sure to back up your data before making any changes.
                                      
Autocalcualted entries
Some categories support autocalculation, which means that the value is automatically calculated based on other categories.
This has to be enabled in the "Categories" window. Autocalculated categories are green and ignore their value in favor of the autocalculated value.
                                      
Dropdown Entries
Some data types support dropdown entries which populate from previously entered data, by most commonly used first.
The number of entries can be configured in "Categories" window.
